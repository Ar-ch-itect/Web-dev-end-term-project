🌸 BLÜM — A Calm Productivity & Life Management App
📌 Project Overview

BLÜM is a frontend-only, DOM-driven productivity web application designed to help users manage tasks, habits, and goals in a calm, visually pleasing environment.
The project focuses on client-side logic, dynamic DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming using Vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any frontend frameworks.

The application behaves like a real-world productivity tool while maintaining simplicity, clarity, and usability.

🎯 Problem Statement

Many productivity tools are either too complex or visually overwhelming for users.
BLÜM aims to solve this by providing a gentle, minimal, and aesthetic productivity space where users can:

Organize tasks, habits, and goals

Track completion progress visually

Manage priorities and deadlines

Interact with a responsive, modern UI

All functionality is handled entirely on the client side.

🧠 Key Features Implemented
✔ Core Features

Add tasks, habits, or goals dynamically

Mark items as completed or delete them

View real-time progress metrics (Total, Completed, Flow %)

Persistent client-side state using LocalStorage

Reset workspace with user confirmation

Filter completed items

🎨 UI / UX Features

Light pink aesthetic with glassmorphism

Soft gradients and smooth hover interactions

Pill-style interactive controls

Priority tags (High / Medium / Low)

Due date support

Dark / Light theme toggle

Fully responsive layout

🧱 DOM & JavaScript Concepts Used
DOM Manipulation

Dynamic creation and removal of elements

Conditional rendering based on application state

Class toggling for visual feedback

Dataset attributes for identifying elements

Event Handling

Click events

Event delegation for dynamically created elements

Form input handling

Toggle-based UI state updates

Application Logic

Centralized state management using JavaScript arrays

State-driven rendering

Separation of logic and UI rendering

Defensive handling of empty inputs and edge cases

Data Handling

JavaScript objects and arrays

LocalStorage for persistent state

JSON serialization and parsing

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Glassmorphism)

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Browser APIs (LocalStorage)

❌ No frameworks
❌ No libraries like jQuery, React, Vue, Angular
❌ No backend server

▶️ How to Run the Project

Download or clone the repository

Ensure the following files are present:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Open index.html in any modern web browser

Start adding tasks and interacting with the app

No installation or build steps required.

🎥 Demo Video

A 3–7 minute demo video is included with the submission, demonstrating:

Task creation and deletion

DOM updates in real time

Progress calculation

UI interactions

State persistence

Theme switching

⚠ Known Limitations

No backend or user authentication

Data is stored locally per browser

No drag-and-drop reordering (intentionally avoided to keep logic DOM-focused)

📚 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of:

Core JavaScript fundamentals

DOM traversal and manipulation

Event-driven application design

Client-side state management

UI/UX decision-making without frameworks

🌷 Conclusion

BLÜM is a complete, functional, and visually refined DOM-based web application that meets all project requirements while showcasing creativity, technical skill, and thoughtful design.
